## What is Gramble?

Gramble is a programming language for *linguistic programming*: building tools that create or respond to human language words and sentences.  It's meant to be easier to read and write, so that people can make linguistic programs in their languages without necessarily having to have a degree in computer science.

Some of the tools you can easily make using Gramble include:

* Verb conjugators
* Writing system conversion tools (for example, turning "ᓄᓇᕗᑦ" into "nunavut", or the other way around)
* Pronunciation guides for computer systems that generate or respond to speech
* "Mad-lib"-style text generators ("I'm so proud of my ______ for ________!")

This tutorial will take you through a lot of the "background" ideas that you'll need to understand to make language technologies like these, and show you how to make them yourself. 

COMING SOON: If you're an experienced "linguist-programmer" (for example, if you already know a toolkit like XFST), we're writing a different version of this specifically for you, outlining the differences between languages like XFST and this language.

## Getting started

You *could* write Gramble in text files or in an ordinary spreadsheet editor, but right now the best way to write it is in Google Sheets.  We've got an "add-on" program that you can embed inside Google Sheets itself, that turns Sheets into an interactive development environment for Gramble.  (And because Google Sheets has sharing built-in, the whole team can work at the same time on the same document.  That's a killer feature for the kind of interdisciplanary work that linguistic programming often requires, between speakers, linguists, and programmers.)

We'll soon be publishing the code on the add-on "store", so that anyone can use it.  In the meantime, ask Pat (patrick.littell at nrc.gc.ca) to deploy a new instance for you.
